    "Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique used for feature selection and regularization. It adds a penalty term to the standard linear regression cost function, which is the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values (known as the residual sum of squares or RSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Lasso is the absolute value of the coefficients (also known as L1 regularization), which means it tries to minimize the absolute magnitude of the coefficients. This has the effect of \"shrinking\" some coefficients towards zero. In some cases, this can lead to coefficients being exactly zero, effectively removing those features from the model. This property makes Lasso useful for feature selection, as it can identify and exclude less important predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques like Ridge Regression (which uses the square of the coefficients, known as L2 regularization), Lasso tends to produce more sparse models (i.e., models with fewer non-zero coefficients). Ridge Regression, on the other hand, tends to shrink coefficients towards zero but rarely makes them exactly zero."
